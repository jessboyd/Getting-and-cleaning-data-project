# How the scripts work

Course project for Coursera course: Getting and Cleaning Data

There is one script required for this analysis which is called 'Run_analysis.R'. 

It requires the data folder to be in the working directory. 

This script does the following:

1. Merges test and train data sets
2. Extracts mean and standard deviation measurements
2. Descriptively names activities in the data set
4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names 
5. Creates a second, tidy data set
